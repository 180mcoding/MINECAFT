He stood there and stared at the lava. Get away from there I screamed! Lonnie jumped back out of the hole as I said. Lonnie wanted to go to the end to defeat the ender dragon for expirence. During the night time they got chased by zombies until they reached a desert biome. Bianca and Lonnie met Emse the new player who, gave them a wooden sword and helped fight the zombie hoard. We were fighting until the sunrise. Bianca asked Emse if he had seen Lonnie in the hospital or ever left the game but Emse never saw Lonnie before, and never saw him leave the game. She explains, that the google read the brain synapses, and Bianca to log off. Bianca hessitate and ask Esme to show her around, and she accepts.</h3>
